# TFIP WordPress Booking Plugin

**TFIP** is a booking plugin for WordPress. Visitors on your website can book a spot for themselves on a specific date and time.

TFIP’s main target is **restaurants and pubs**, but it works in any situation where you need to manage client bookings—gyms, co-working spaces, event venues, community centers, and more.

As an admin, you can customize **timeslots** to match your schedule. Set up default timeslots, or create unique ones for each day. A built-in **calendar view** lets you easily monitor and manage all bookings in one place.

TFIP comes with a lightweight **event system**. You can create and manage three types of events—**Sport, Music, and Food**—and connect bookings directly to them.

To make communication easier, TFIP can connect to the **WhatsApp Web API** so you can:  
- Automatically send booking confirmations to your customers.  
- Receive instant notifications in your company WhatsApp when a booking is created.
